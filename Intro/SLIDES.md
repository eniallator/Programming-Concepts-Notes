# Slides

## Course Outline

- As if we know nothing
- Whats a problem/algorithm/computation
- Developing an algorithm
- Rigorously argue an algorithm will work
- Measure efficiency of an algorithm and complexity of a problem

- Focus on algorithmic thinking, not coding
- Basic data structures as well as searching/sorting/other simple and intuitive algorithms
- Correctness and complexity
  - Algorithms should only compute correct solutions of a problem

## Specifications

- What is it?

  - A description of what it's supposed to do
  - Expressed in terms meaniningful to the user
  - Independent from details of how the system works

- What's a system?

  - A physical process for carrying out a range of tasks

## Task Details

- 2 distinct levels of task descriptions

  - Implementation is a detailed description of the various steps about how the task is performed
  - Specification is a high level external description about what is performed

- Example:
  - Specification: bake a chocolate mousse
  - Implementation: Melt chocolate, when melted... â¬… a recipe

## Large VS Small Projects

- In the large:

  - Construction of large complex systems
  - Large programming teams
  - Split system into modules
  - Many programmers; many modules; many users; many tools; many version; many years

- In the small:
  - Individual software component
  - Well defined

## What's an algorithmic problem

- Specifying an algorithmic problem:

  - A characterisation of all legal inputs
  - A description of the required outputs as a function of the inputs

- Example
  - Largest element in Set
  - Legal inputs:
    - Any **finite** set of elements where elements must be _comparable_
  - Required outputs:
    - The largest element in the input set

## What is an algorithm

- An algorithm consists of an ordered list of **basic** operations which for every valid input:

  - Determines a finite sequence of operations to be performed
  - Halts
  - Produces some output

- Recipe for a _system_ to carry out a task

- Level of detail that's enough for the algorithm to be carried out for a specific user/person
  - E.g high level of detail for an amateur, low for professional
  - Same language used for same person

### Revisited

- Basic operations must be:

  - Elementary and unambiguous - require no creativity
  - Understandable by system executing the algorithm

- Level of detail appropriate to system executing the algorithm

## Summary

- Description of algorithmic problems
- Their solutions using algorithms (whether my algorithm is correct)
- The design of algorithms (have you fully understood the problem)

- TODO:
  - Check the webpage frequently
  - Look through the lecture notes when they're up
